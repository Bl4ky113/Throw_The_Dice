# Throw The Dice!!!

Part of the project "Revisitando projectos" (Revisiting projects). Where I recreate old projects from when I was learning the basics of Web Dev, learning, and trying new things while I remake these projects.

This original project was made in the last months of 2020 for Misión TIC 2020 programming courses.

# The Original project

It's a project were I made a very simple simulator of throwing a pair of dice. The teachers of Misión TIC 2020 told us to make an even simpler excersice, using the console of the web browsers. But I wanted to make something more complex than that. So I learned a bit of CSS, which I didn't know to well. And I made the project. 

I thought that they were going to say something because of the complexity of the project, in comparison to the normal exersice, but they didn't.
